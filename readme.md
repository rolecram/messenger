Messenger is a project to implement a messaging system for hotels.<br/>
I use AWS API gateway, AWS DynamoDb, AWS Lambda functions and AWS Cloud Formation<br/>
<br/>
The HTML, CSS and Javascript (ECMA6) code were written manually without using any code generation tools.
<br/><br/>
As editor I use VSCode with the git extensions.
<br/><br/>
Although it is not yet integrated with AWS Cognito, in the lambda-functions/api-gateway-token-verify directory the JWT check is implemented, which is passed as a parameter at connection time.
<br/><br/>
In the cognito directory there is an HTML test to verify the user using cognito with MFA only the first time.
